## How to Run the Python Files

<p>To run the diabetes_regression.py file (or any one of the python files for this homework) one must first ensure the computer has all of the necessary python libraries installed on their system. The libraries needed are matplotlib, pandas, os, sklearn, numpy, math and seaborn.<p>
<p>To install these libraries, you will use the pip installer in the terminal and run the code as follows:

```python
pip3 install matplotlib
```

### To Run the Code Once Libraries Installed
For running the code one has 2 options:
1. Run it within the terminal
2. Run it in an editor such as PyCharm

### Running in the Terminal
<p>To run the python file in the terminal, it is important to ensure you are in the proper directory containing the diabetes_regression.py file, as well as the diabetes.data. To run, would then perform the following command:
```python
python3 diabetes_regression.py
```

### Running in PyCharm
<p>To run the python file in PyCharm you must first create a PyCharm project. This project will create all the project metadata to help run the file, and the project folder must contain the diabetes_regession.py, kneighbors.py, Ridge_Regression.py, and Lasso_Regression.py files, as well as the diabetes.data file. To run the file, either click on the green arrow at the top right of the screen, or right click within the body of the code and then click on run. 

## Comparing the Regression Methods
<p>For the regression analysis, I performed 4 different analyses (two required,two additional): a basic linear regression, nearest neighbor, ridge regression, and lasso regression. For these analyses the one with the best seemed to be the linear regression, because it had the lowest RMSE. These can all be compared via the graphs done for each.<p>
